# Couper Example Collection

[Couper](https://couper.io) is designed to support developers
building and operating API-driven Web projects by offering security
and observability functionality in a lightweight API gateway
component.

This collection of examples highlights Couper's features with small, ready-to-use examples.

## Getting started

To run the examples you need Couper 2. Couper is available as docker
image from
[https://hub.docker.com/r/avenga/couper](https://hub.docker.com/r/avenga/couper).

To run the examples, start Couper in a docker container and share the
example's directory into the container:

```sh
$ cd simple-fileserving
$ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)":/conf avenga/couper

{"addr":"0.0.0.0:8080","level":"info","message":"couper gateway is serving","timestamp":"2020-08-27T16:39:18Z","type":"couper"}
â€¦
```

Now Couper is serving on your computer's port 8080. Point your
browser or `curl` to `http://localhost:8080` to see what's going on.

Press `CTRL+c` to stop the container.
